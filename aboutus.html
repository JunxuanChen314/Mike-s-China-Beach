	      <h1>🥢 Our History</h1>
	      <p>We are the founders of this Chinese restaurant. Thirty years ago, we came to the United States from China and settled in Miami, Florida. We didn’t speak the language or know the city well, but we had one goal: to bring the flavors of our hometown here.</p>
	  
	      <p>Back then, we had no fancy decor or big capital. We rented a small kitchen, sourced our own ingredients, cooked every dish by hand, and did everything ourselves. Slowly, people began to return for our food and got to know us. One step at a time, we built what you see today.</p>
	  
	      <h2>🍽️ The Taste of Home, From the First Dish</h2>
	      <p>We’ve always insisted on using the most authentic ingredients and traditional cooking methods to recreate classic dishes from both northern and southern China. Our Orange Chicken is crispy on the outside and tender inside with the perfect sweet-and-sour balance — a favorite among customers. Our Honey Chicken is rich in aroma and sauce, with every bite deeply satisfying. We also serve Mapo Tofu, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Fried Rice — each one is a taste passed down through generations.</p>
	  
	      <h2>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 A Family’s Effort, A 30-Year Reputation</h2>
	      <p>We’re not a chain restaurant, and we’ve never advertised. Everything has grown through word of mouth. Many of our diners first came as kids with their parents — now they bring their own children. Over three decades, we’ve watched generations grow up and witnessed the evolution of Miami’s Chinese community.</p>
	  
	      <p>One customer once said, “Your food isn’t the most photogenic, but it’s always the most delicious.” To us, that’s the highest praise we could receive.</p>
	  
	      <h2>🌞 A Touch of Eastern Warmth in Sunny Miami</h2>
	      <p>Our restaurant is more than a place to eat — it’s part of the community. Longtime neighbors come in just for tea and conversation, and newcomers are often surprised by how warm and welcoming the atmosphere is. We’ve always believed that food doesn’t just fill the stomach — it brings people closer.</p>
	  
	      <p>Whether you’re visiting for the first time or returning after a while, we sincerely invite you to join us, taste something familiar, and feel the love we put into every meal.</p>
